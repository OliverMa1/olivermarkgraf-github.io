I am a Ph.D student at the University of Kaierslautern-Landau, Germany. I am advised by Professor Anthony W. Lin. 

I work on formal methods and automated reasoning, with a primary focus on SMT solving and the theory of strings. 
A central part of my work is the design, implementation, and engineering of practical systems that turn theoretical ideas into usable tools.

I am involved in the development of the string solver [**OSTRICH**](https://github.com/uuverifiers/ostrich), where my work focuses on algorithmic design and implementation for string reasoning. 
Beyond string solvers, I am broadly interested in automated reasoning topics such as SAT/SMT solving, constraint solving, finite automata, and program analysis.

Alongside research and system building, I enjoy teaching and mentoring undergraduate students through projects and thesis supervision.

I am often accompanied by my Persian cat, Emi, who takes her supervisory role very seriously.
